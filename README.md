This repository contains a machine learning forecasting project designed to predict the on-road population of electric vehicles (EVs) for the next 5 years. The project leverages Python and relevant libraries to analyze historical data and generate future projections.

## 📂 **Project Files**
1. **`forecasting.ipynb`**  
   Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, forecasting, and visualization.
   
2. **`Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv`**  
   Historical dataset used for training and validating the forecasting model. It includes details about the EV population growth over time.

## 🚀 **Features**
- **Data Analysis:** Insights into historical trends of electric vehicle adoption.
- **Forecasting Model:** Time series forecasting using machine learning techniques.
- **Visualization:** Graphical representation of past trends and future projections.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Prophet)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Plotly for visualization

## 📊 **Forecast Objective**
- Predict the number of electric vehicles on the road for the next 5 years based on historical data.
- Analyze growth trends to support planning and decision-making for EV infrastructure and policy.

## 📈 **How to Use**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Soumyadipta2020/ml_forecasting.git
   cd ml_forecasting
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
